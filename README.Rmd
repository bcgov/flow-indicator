# River and Stream Flow Indicator

### Usage

This repository contains R scripts that utilize openly available hydrometric data from the Water Survey of Canada (data source [one]('https://dd.weather.gc.ca/hydrometric/csv/') and [two]('https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/hydrometrics/www/')) to construct an interactive flow dashboard including a map, and to produce a static version of the same indicator as a downloadable PDF.

There are two core scripts that are required for the analysis; they need to be run in order:

-   01_clean.R
-   02_analysis.R

Following the successful implementation of these scripts, the interactive flow dashboard can be generated by running the following script in the 'app' folder:

-   flow_shiny_app.R

The static PDF version of this indicator can be generated using the following script in the 'print_ver' folder:

-   Factsheets.Rmd
