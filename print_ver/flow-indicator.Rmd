Changes in the timing and volume of river flow can affect both natural ecosystems and human 
communities - they can affect our ability to predict and manage seasonal water resources and
flood risks, and may impact natural systems that rely on natural flow patterns. Low river flows
in summer may reduce the amount of water available for agriculture, hydroelectric power generation,
industry and communities. Low river flows are also associated with declines in water quality and 
warmer water temperatures which can threaten the health of aquatic ecosystems. The indicator measures
several metrics representing river flow at 'r nrow()'
